# Contributing to MicroLog

If you want to contribute feel free to open an issue or create Pull Request with your changes. Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

- Library design: [design.md](doc/design.md).
- Code organization: [code.md](doc/code.md).

Recommended setup:

- VS Code with devcontainer extension
- Docker installed
- Open `microlog.code-workspace` and reopen it in devcontainer

About pull requests:

- I may ask you to fix some issues before merging or update the `version` file.
- Please update unit tests accordingly if you add new features or change existing ones.
- Please ensure that the code is formatted according to the project's style (use `clang-format`).
